How to run your first steps in CFDInsight:

PRE-REQUISITES:
    * ParaView v6.0 or superior (compatibility with previous versions is not guaranteed).
    * OpenFOAM v2312 or superior.

1) place the `Propeller` dict where you prefer.
2) Open a terminal window in `path/to/Propeller/600rpm`.
3) Run your OpenFOAM alias in the terminal (if you don' have one type `path/to/openfoamXXXX/etc/bashrc`).
4) Run the commands `. runMesh.sh` and `. runSolve.sh`.

5) Take a look at `CFDInsight/global_settings.py` to customize settings.
   (e.g. to minimize your post-processing time, make `pvserver_np` equal to the number of 
    CPU processors you are willing to use).

6) Take a look at the `initialConditions`, `Keywords.py` and `Preferences.py` files.
7) Call `CFDInsight` in the terminal you've previously opened.
8) Above the `DeltaSurfaces` settings, you will find instructions to create a simple baseline to compare this case to.
